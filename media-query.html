            <h2>1 Nephi 1:20</h2>
            <p>
                And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; 
                yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, 
                and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that 
                they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto 
                you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom 
                he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even 
                unto the power of deliverance.

            <p>
                Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends 
                of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; 
                and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.
